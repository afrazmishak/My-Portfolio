            <p className="Paragraph Paragraph1">Islam is a complete way of life that guides a person in every moment, from how to speak, how to behave, how to treat others, and how to connect with Allah, the One who created everything.</p>
            <p className="Paragraph Paragraph2">At its root, the word “Islam” means:</p>
            <ul>

              <li>Submission to Allah</li>

            </ul>
            <p className="Paragraph Paragraph3">This means true peace comes when a person submits their heart, mind, and life to the One who knows them better than they know themselves.</p>

            <h1 className="Heading1">The Essence of Islam</h1>
            <p className="Paragraph">Islam is a complete way of life that guides a person in every moment, helping them live with peace, purpose, and clarity. It teaches that true peace comes from worshipping one God, Allah, and following the guidance He sent through His final messenger, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Islam is simple, pure, and practical. It answers the deepest questions of life and gives the heart a sense of direction and calmness.</p>

            <p className="Paragraph">Islam is not just a belief, it is a way of living. It shows in the everyday actions of a person. Islam appears in speaking kindly, treating others with respect, staying honest even when it is difficult, controlling anger, forgiving people, helping those who are struggling, and remaining grateful for every blessing. It is more than prayer and fasting; it is the daily effort to build a clean heart and a strong character that reflects goodness.</p>

            <p className="Paragraph">Islam also offers clear guidance for every stage of life. When people feel lost, confused, or unsure about the right path, Islam provides answers that bring comfort and stability. It teaches why we are created, what our purpose is, how we should live, and what happens after death. The Qur’an and the teachings of the Prophet ﷺ give a person direction in their morals, decisions, relationships, and daily behaviour, making life easier to navigate with confidence and wisdom.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="IsalmContext">
          <p className="Paragraph">At the heart of Islam is mercy. Allah’s mercy is seen in every aspect of life, in the love of parents, the beauty of nature, the ease inside hardship, and the kindness we show to one another. Islam encourages mercy in every action: mercy in speech, mercy in forgiveness, mercy towards the poor, mercy towards animals, and mercy even in the way a person prays and interacts with the world. The Prophet ﷺ taught that Allah shows mercy to those who are merciful to others.</p>

          <p className="Paragraph">Islam is a message for all people, everywhere. It does not belong to any specific nationality, race, or language. Its teachings are universal and accessible to anyone who is searching for truth, peace, and a meaningful life. Islam welcomes questions, invites learning, and encourages people to seek understanding with an open heart. Anyone, from any background, can explore Islam and experience its beauty.</p>

          <p className="Paragraph">In simple words, Islam is peace, guidance, mercy, and purpose. It connects a person with their Creator and fills the heart with clarity and direction. Through Islam, life becomes more meaningful, actions become more conscious, and the heart becomes more calm. It is not just a religion, it is a beautiful path that leads the soul toward truth and inner peace.</p>
